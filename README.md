# 💻 Shivam’s GitHub Profile  

## 🚀 About Me  
Hi there 👋 I’m Shivam, a 2nd-year Computer Science student at KIIT (2024–2028). I love learning by building, exploring modern web technologies, and solving real problems through code.  

Currently, I’m working on projects that combine **full-stack development, automation, and AI/ML** — often with a lot of help and inspiration from my seniors and peers.  

## 🔭 Current Projects  
- **Academis** 🎓 – Academic progress tracker with subject planning, daily tracking, revision cycles, and question paper management.  
- **Elevate** 🏋️ – A fitness companion dashboard with progress visualizations.  
- **Literary Lodge** 📚 – A reader-first hub for managing books and reading goals.  
- **Pixel Résumé** 📝 – A privacy-first, ATS-optimized résumé builder.  

## 🎯 Goals  
- Deepen expertise in **Next.js, TypeScript, and AI model integration**.  
- Explore scalable architectures and automation workflows.  
- Grow holistically: stronger physically 💪, sharper mentally 🧠, and more consistent in execution.  

## 📖 Current Learning  
- Building secure and scalable web apps with **Next.js, Tailwind, Firebase, Supabase**.  
- Experimenting with **AI/ML workflows** (Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).  
- Working on collaborative projects in student communities ( USC KIIT, IoT Lab).
